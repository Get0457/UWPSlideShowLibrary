# UWPSlideShowLibrary
UWP Slide Show Library that makes making slide show easier by abstracting Slide show code in the back. By using this project, you only need to work on a bit of UI Code.

Why do I do this?
* It has more possibilities, such as static background, acrylic, mica, easing animations, or programmable UI automation, and actually anything you can do in UWP.

Example Project with 2 slides is included. (only basic features, does not include what I say is "possible." If you can understand the code written in the sample project and have basic UWP knowledge then you might be able to do what you wanted.)
